<text>When sky blue gets dark enough To see the colors of the city lights A trail of ruby red and diamond white Hits her like a sunrise She comes and goes and comes and goes Like no one can Tonight she''s out to lose herself And find a high on Peachtree Street From mixed drinks to techno beats it''s always Heavy into everything She comes and goes and comes and goes Like no one can She comes and goes and no one knows She''s slipping through my hands She''s always buzzing just like Neon, neon Neon, neon Who knows how long, how long, how long She can go before she burns away I can''t be her angel now You know it''s not my place to hold her down And it''s hard for me to take a stand When I would take her anyway I can She comes and goes and comes and goes Like no one can She comes and goes and no one knows She''s slipping through my hands She''s always buzzing just like Neon, neon Neon, neon Who knows how long, how long, how long She can go before she burns away</text>

<text>Take all of your wasted honor Every little past frustration Take all of your so-called problems, Better put ''em in quotations Say what you need to say [8x] Walking like a one man army Fighting with the shadows in your head Living out the same old moment Knowing you''d be better off instead, If you could only . . .  Say what you need to say [8x] Have no fear for giving in Have no fear for giving over You''d better know that in the end It''s better to say too much Than never to say what you need to say again Even if your hands are shaking And your faith is broken Even as the eyes are closing Do it with a heart wide open (a wide heart) Say what you need to say [24x]</text>

<text>Right from the start You were a thief You stole my heart And I your willing victim I let you see the parts of me That weren''t all that pretty And with every touch you fixed them Now you''ve been talking in your sleep oh oh Things you never say to me oh oh Tell me that you''ve had enough Of our love, our love Just give me a reason Just a little bit''s enough Just a second we''re not broken just bent And we can learn to love again It''s in the stars It''s been written in the scars on our hearts We''re not broken just bent And we can learn to love again </text>

<text>I threw a wish in the well, Don''t ask me, I''ll never tell I looked to you as it fell, And now you''re in my way I''d trade my soul for a wish, Pennies and dimes for a kiss I wasn''t looking for this, But now you''re in my way Your stare was holdin'', Ripped jeans, skin was showin ''Hot night, wind was blowin'' Where do you think you''re going, baby?</text>

<text>High dive into frozen waves where the past comes back to life Fight fear for the selfish pain, it was worth it every time Hold still right before we crash ''cause we both know how this ends A clock ticks ''til it breaks your glass and I drown in you again ''Cause you are the piece of me I wish I didn''t need Chasing relentlessly, still fight and I don''t know why If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?</text>
